Airlines Data Analysis

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction

A Power BI dashboard is created to analyse and understand:

distribution of flights based on airlines, their classes, cities, stops and timing
how each airline's ticket price varies with each other
whether the price and duration is related to each other or not
how the price is distributed between each class- Business and Economy
distribution of price based on cities
top 3 airlines based on their ticket price
Different charts and graphs based on the data types were used to build this dashboard.
This analysis will be helpful to track the availability and performance of each airline.
